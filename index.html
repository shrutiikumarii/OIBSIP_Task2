            <h1 class="title"> The Life of Late Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan</h1>
            <p>Major Sandeep was born on March 15, 1977, in Calicut.</p>

            <p>He grew up in Bangalore and went on to complete the NDA's 94th course and the IMA's 104th course.</p>
            
            <p> On the 12th of June 1999, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Indian Army's Bihar Regiment.</p>
            
            <p> From his childhood, he always wanted the uniform.</p>
            
        <p>His pure dedication and love for the uniform made him top the most difficult course of the Indian Army i.e, the Ghatak course at Commando Training School, Belgaum. </p>
            
    <p> He also received an instructor grade and a commendation for the same. He went on to Gulmarg's High Altitude Warfare School for further training.</p>
            
            <p>During his service, he served in Gujarat (during the Gujarat riots in 2002), Rajasthan, Siachen Hyderabad, and Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
            
        <p>He was later chosen to join the National Security Guards and provided with the training. In January 2007, he was assigned as the training officer of the 51st Special Action Group.</p>
            
            <p>On the fateful day of November 26, 2008, when ten Laskar-e-Taiba terrorists attacked various buildings in Mumbai, a team of 51 SAG led by Major Sandeep was dispatched to safely rescue the hostages from the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.</p>
            
        <p>Major Sandeep led a team of ten commandos up the stairwell to rescue hostages from the hotel's sixth and fifth floors. They broke the door and encountered terrorists who opened fire on the team, injuring commando Sunil Kumar Yadav in both legs. Major Sandeep was able to evacuate him, but the terrorists fled the commando team using a grenade blast. In contrast, the team was unconcerned about their own safety and continued rescuing hostages for the next 15 hours. It was finally time to confront the terrorist and free the remaining hostages.</p>
            
           <p>He was just 31 years old when he gave his life to protect the citizens of this country and their dignity.</p></div>
